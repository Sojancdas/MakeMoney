You Should grock fast, what transending means.

It is not enough to just transend.

In me I shall see, the works done by me, shine enlightenment to the.

##########################################################################################
The first program I tried to implement was a password program written in BASIC.
I wrote it well, it worked in the programming environment. Then I tried to apply it to my operating system.
I think I forgot to compile it, anyway, this was my first traumatic emotional experience with the non-thinking device, called computer.
I cried, thinking I broke the thing, since it refused to run the password program uncompiled and just stopped doing anything while booting.
In panic I entered the SYSTEM and did a low-level disk format. Ha! :) That looked way too scarry as the percentage was rising so I canceled it before it was finished. Ha! 
That took away the disk partition tables.

Yes. I did have an advanced operating system called MS-DOS 6.0 installed when I first got that 386 thing. But after this first programming/low-level-formating experience I had only MS-DOS 3.0. 
Why? 
The guy that repaired the mess, put it there. My father drove the 386 to the servis, he had no luck with me.

But since then I learned. Breaking stuff means pain, suffering, but if you can forget about that shit and focus on learning, then you can understand your self in clear ways.

Sometimes I go ahead and brake many code-parts, just to suffer the next days in debugging my little fractalic nature.

I to me, seem to be, the creator of the. But behold stranger, do not take a breath without thinking your way is the best way.
Since when is coding humans been allowed? I know when I am, what I am. 

/*
 * IITransender programming.
 * You do all programming for IITransender through a json formatted string with conventioned structure and naming.
 * The program.json is a simple array, yet very cool, since each entry represents one transend = one screen = one inline Application(view),
 *
 * Structure looks like this:
 * [ "ii":"(string_transend_fractal)", "ions":{(hash_transend_informations)}, "ior":{(hash_transend_behavior)} ]
 *
 * transend_fractal can be:
 * "ii":"#{ACustom}View" - if you want to transend a whole view controller named #{ACustom}ViewController, subclassed from IIController
 * "ii":"message" - if you want to display a message with or without local/remote background and/or icon, useful for almost any information to meditate upon
 * "ii":"filename.mov" - if you just want to play a movie
 * "ii":"filename.caf" - if you want to play a <30 second sound
 * "ii":"filename.jpg" - if you want to transend an image
 * 
 * transend_informations can hold any value, but these are reserved, since they get feched magicaly:
 * "url":"(valid_url)" - used in many transend_fractals as base url to act upon
 * "background":"(cached_path_or_name)" - a cached image or resource image
 * "background_url":"(url_path)" - url to be downloaded from to get the background - this always stops transending
 * "icon":"(cached_path_or_name)" - a cached small image or resource small image
 * 
 * transend_behavior is used only for defining behavior of transend
 * "effect":(integer) - can have values: 0 - MoveIn, 1 - Push, 2 - Reveal, 3 - Fade (using numbers to decrease size of req typing drastically)
 * "stop":(true|false) - if true, calls [transender meditate], the one white button lightens up, time stops, meditate upon the transend
 * "..." - all other values you can implement if you need
 *
