It is not a Way, more like a passage.

Life is passing wile this Application is running.

Every 3.8 seconds this Application transends. 

Transends with something like this.

You Should grock fast, what transending means.

It is not enough to just transend.

Go from transending into meditation by tapping on the Button.

You stopped meditation and started transending again.

With the Button you can transend any meditation. 

The Button is white while still transending every 3.8 seconds.

Tap the Button and you can meditate on any transend.

The Button is white and red while You are meditating. - stop

It is not here to prove anything, but to Give.
