just added "t":{}, to transender program. checkout -b progress 
storekit. every transend you can medidate upon, should be for a good price. that is how the reptile would do it.

I give you all you earn, just enter your pay pals or money bookers.

vmes je prišla, malo pokukala v garažo, potem plaho nadaljevala, dokler ni ugotovila, da imam prerdeče oči in me skoraj prepričala, da naj bom spet jezen nanjo, ker mi hoče vrečt kukije stran.

this kukis are cool. they do not harm you. they only enlighten you. so you do not make mistakes. so you can own the truth, walk the truth, see the truth.

i love the spiritual buzz. i am a natural healer. nobody knows who I am. 

I am in Your hearts desire for free growth. I am the moment that wakes you up.

Transend this.

šiškaputana, nič od tega kar sem prej natipko, ne bom naredjo. dobre zamisli je dobro zavreči, če razmišljanje o njih pripelje v nejasnost.
preprostost torej najdem skozi ljubezen do samega sebe. ko vem, česa nočem, o tistem ne razmišljam.

thinking about goldcut - cutting the transender program into two pieces, one can switch beetween by simple shaking
first part would work as a menu second as content or whatever other simple way to use.

READ A LEGEND ABOUT HOW THE Progress WAS USED:

#bugfix + code was broken, feature did not work/behave as expected or was breaking other code
#visionary + code nobody ordered, but has spiritual potential and behind-the-scene value, grown directly from the developers mind or whomevers hearts desire
#theeye + code implemented for theeye is like code implemented directly for God-Goddes/SelfNature, usually accompanied with great motivation for doing good
#zoom + code did work, but this change made it powerful, look better and taste fine
#submit + submit (used standalone)
#cut + proposal (used standalone)
